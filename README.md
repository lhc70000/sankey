by He Chen LI, Shi Ying LI, Bo Wen TAN and Shuai Cheng LI.

This project contains the source code for the above paper. The paper has been submitted to the [IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium 2021](http://vis.tju.edu.cn/pvis2021/).

## Requirements

This project uses **Python 3.7**. We uses the following packages (click for installation guide):

* [numpy and matplotlib](https://scipy.org/install.html);

* [pulp](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/main/installing_pulp_at_home.html) (for implementing the Integer Linear Programming method in paper ["Optimal Sankey Diagrams Via Integer Programming"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8365985)).

## Test Cases Reproduction

### **Test against the state-of-art heuristic combined method**

#### Dataset

The dataset used in this test is the same one used in the paper ["EnergyViz: an interactive system for visualization of energy systems"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-015-1186-8) where the combined method is introduced. It is the the Canada energy flow data in 1978 from [Canadian Energy Systems Analysis Research](https://www.cesarnet.ca/) website. However, the dataset is no longer available as shown in [this page](https://www.cesarnet.ca/visualization/sankey-diagrams-canadas-energy-systems?scope=Canada&year=1978&hide=all&modifier=none#chart-form). As a result, we build an artificial dataset based on the combined method's result figure. The dataset is a json file available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/input/heur_case.json) in the **input** folder.

#### Source code

The source code of this test is available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/algorithm/heur_case.py) in the **algorithm** folder.

#### Output file

The output file of this test is available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/heur_case.txt) in the **output** folder. It contains the ordering as well as the non-weighted and weighted crossing of results from the combined method and both stages of our method.

#### Visualization

Visualizations of these output orderings from the [combined method](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/heur_case_comb_result.html), the [Markov stage](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/heur_case_stage1_result.html) and the [Refinement stage](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/heur_case_stage2_result.html) are available in the **visualization** folder.

### **Test against the ILP and BC method**

#### Dataset

The dataset used in this test is the same one used in the paper ["Optimal Sankey Diagrams Via Integer Programming"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8365985) where the ILP method is introduced. It is the ["World Greenhouse Gas Emissions"](http://pdf.wri.org/working_papers/world_greenhouse_gas_emissions_2005.pdf) data from the World Resource Institute. This dataset is a json file available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/input/ilp_case.json) in the **input** folder.

#### Source code

The source code of this test is available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/algorithm/ilp_case.py) in the **algorithm** folder.

#### Output file

The output file of this test is available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/ilp_case.txt) in the **output** folder. It contains the ordering as well as the non-weighted and weighted crossing of results from the BC method, the ILP method and both stages of our method.

#### Visualization

Visualizations of these output orderings from the [BC method](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/ilp_case_BC_result.html), the [ILP method](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/ilp_case_ILP_result.html), the [Markov stage](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/ilp_case_Stage1_result.html) and the [Refinement stage](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/visualization/ilp_case_Stage2_result.html) are available in the **visualization** folder.

### **Test on the circular form of the Sankey diagram**

#### Source code

The source code of this test is available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/algorithm/cycle.py) in the **algorithm** folder. It also contains code that generated the 20 test cases on circular Sankey diagram.

#### Output files

The output files of this test are two figures, respectively the [dumbbell plot](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/dumbbell.png) and the [boxplot](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/box.png), available in the **output** folder.

### **Robust Test**

#### Dataset

All test cases are generated by a python script available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/algorithm/robust_test_case_generator.py) in the **algorithm** folder. The generated test cases are summarized in the [robust](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/tree/master/input/robust) folder within the **input** folder. The script also returns a [json file](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/input/robust/caseInfo.json) containing the average edge number in each 10 test cases associated with a pair of (n, V).

#### Source code

We implemented the ILP method as a python script using the pulp package [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/algorithm/robust_test_ilp.py) in the **algorithm** folder. And the source code of our method is available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/algorithm/robust_test_method.py) in the **algorithm** folder.

#### Output files

The output files of the ILP script and our method's script are json files available [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/robust_ilp_result.json) and [here](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/robust_method_result.json) in the **output** folder. The figure given in our paper is written in JavaScript based on this [summarized result file](https://gitlab.deepomics.org/lhc/sankey/blob/master/output/robust_test_result_summarized.json).
